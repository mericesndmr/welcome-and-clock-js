# Frontend Bootcamp Preparation Program Week 5 Homework 1

## I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this assignment.

## The aim of the project is to get a name from the user with the prompt command and create a text according to this name. Presenting time information to the user instantly.

## In the project, only the time was requested, but I also wanted to add date information.

## I tried to make it more fluid than visual. To do this "display:flex;" I used the structure.

## I also made it compatible with other browsers with "normalize.css".
## I was going to use "@media" for mobile devices and big screens but when I reviewed it I thought it was compatible.
